# Toolbar Icons

Icons are designed using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) and exported as Plain SVG files.

## Designing Icons
There is a Inkscape project file [inkscape_project.svg](inkscape_project.svg) in this folder for easy editing of the icons.

Use layers to separate different base icons and accents.


### Exporting icons

From the layers panel select visible elements and hide everything else.

Use `File > Export` to export the icons. Use `Plain SVG` format to export the icons so that no Inkscape-specific data is included in the SVG file.

### Using QGIS icons as a base

QGIS icons can be found from the `QGIS/images/themes/default` folder of the source of the QGIS project. You probably want to clone the QGIS repository from GitHub to get access to these files.

A list of current icons can also be found from https://pyqgis-icons-cheatsheet.geotribu.fr/
